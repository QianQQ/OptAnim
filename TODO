- Constraint and Objective should be subclasses of 1 superclass, and should be added to animations in the same way
- Name animations better. Each parameter should contribute a short string to the final name (ex. Mortimer_locomote_1.4mps_1.0rad_forward.bvh)
- More realistic modeling of joints/muscles
- Add system for making transition animations (between frames of regular animations)
- Fix CMA-ES for contact optimization (or eliminate the need for it by reformulating the spacetime problem)
